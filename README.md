The average person spends about 150 minutes (2.5 hours) on social media per day. It takes about 5 minutes to smoke a cigarette. How many packs worth of online slop are you smoking?

Each cigarette on Cigareditte takes 5 minutes to smoke. Within your allotted smoke break time window, you are free to browse any of the top, new, or best stories from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Embedded windows let you browse stories in the app, with options to view comments on Hacker News or open the page in a new tab. When your cigarette runs out, you'll need to light another one to get back to where you were. 

The app keeps track of how many cigarettes you smoke during your session. Good luck. Pixel art inspired and provided by [minetoblend](https://www.deviantart.com/minetoblend/art/Pixel-Art-Ashtray-613081396).
